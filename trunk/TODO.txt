Maay TODO List
==============

converter.py:
-------------

TODO: add support for xls, ppt,  openoffice, mp3, ogg

XXX: need to handle file encodings


dbentity.py:   
------------

FIXME : UNKNOWN_STATE gets stored in the
          database as a char in table Document or
          as a tinyint(4) in table files. Check

XXX mimetype handling is a HACK. It needs to be integrated
     nicely in order to handle any kind of restrictions easily

XXX: LIMIT clause should be optional

indexer.py:
-----------

TODO: analyse the God class into something understandable

TODO: manage periodical runs

TODO: memorize state of indexed document to avoid db lookup at each run

TODO: do an initial db query to initialize the indexation state (?)

querier.py:                
-----------
FIXME: find a better way to perform this operation
       the autodetection of the charset guesses latin-1 and
       this obviously does not work with unicode

FIXME: update node_interests too

XXX Decide if we can compute the content_hash and mime_type ourselves
    or if the indexer should do it and pass the values as an argument

TODO: order results using document_scores information

registration.py:
----------------

TODO: auto logout after a given time to save memory

rpc.py:    
-------

FIXME: need a better implementation

XXX: need to differenciate bad cnxId and no last mod time

server.py:        
----------

XXX: logout message should be forwarded to registration server

XXX make sure that the requested document is really in the database

XXX don't forget to update the download statistics of the document

XXX abstract attribute should be a unicode string

texttool.py:
------------

XXX FIXME: this function probably already exists somewhere ...

TODO: port original code from htmltotext

XXX: this is a quick and dirty implementation
