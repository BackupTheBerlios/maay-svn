Release Notes for version 0.2.4

See README.txt for installation and quick start instructions. 

This release is beta-level software, which contains several bug fixes
and improvements over 0.2.2. The 0.2.3 version was not released
officially, and only contains a few bugfixes concerning the 
windows services management.

If you encounter any problem with the web interface (like 
never ending requests, pages not updated), please notify us and
describe the problem. In this case, don't forget to mention which
browser (name and version) and which platform you're using.

The windows installer will install and set up all the required
dependencies (including mysql and twisted). It uses Inno Setup and
Py2exe.
