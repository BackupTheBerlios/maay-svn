This document is a collection of tips to help Maay contributors. It
will be expanded as needs arise.


Generating a Windows installer
==============================

Setting up the Windows machine
------------------------------

Download and install `Python 2.4`_ and update your PATH environment variable
so that c:\python24 belongs to the path. Do it right away this will 
save precious time and frustration.

Install `Inno Setup`_, `py2exe`_, `pywin32`_ which are used to produce
the installer. You will probably want to install a Subversion client
such as `Tortoise SVN`_, as well as putty_ to benefit from the
``pageant`` ssh agent and avoid typing your berlios password again and
again. 

Checkout the Maay sources from Berlios. 

You need to install the dependencies of Maay too. Download and install
the following python modules (take care when downloading a windows
installer, it has to be built for Python 2.4): 

 * `egenix-mx-base`_
 * `mysql-python`_
 * `twisted-2.0.1`_ 
 * `nevow-0.6`_
 * `PIL`_
 * `logilab-common-0.12.1`_

If there is no windows installer available for the package, it most
certainly means that it is a pure Python library. Unpack the source
archive in a temporary directory and use a command prompt window to
run ``python setup.py bdist_wininst`` in that directory. This will
generate a Windows installer in the ``dist`` subdirectory, which you
can run to install the library.

Download the `mysql-4.1-noinstall` prebuilt zip file, and unzip it in
``trunk\thirdparty`` (where ``trunk`` is the Subversion checkout
directory). Rename ``trunk\thirdparty\mysql-4.1`` to
``trunk\thirdparty`mysql``.

Download and unpack `antiword`_, `unrtf`_ and `pdftohtml` in
``trunk\thirdparty``. I think this is all and correct. Fortunately,
all of this only has to be done once.

Generating the installer
------------------------

 * In a shell window, navigate to the trunk directory. 

 * Run ``python setup.py py2exe > py2exe.log``

 * Examine ``py2exe.log`` for possible errors or missing modules

 * Launch Inno setup by double clickink on ``maay.iss``

 * Select the right option in the menu to generate the installer

It is probably possible to right click on ``maay.iss`` and to compile
directly from Windows Explorer. I prefer compiling from the Inno Setup
GUI because it is possible to run the installer and uninstaller from
the application and get a log displayed.

What if it does not work?

wrong. Please send a mail on the ``maay-dev`` mailing list and we will
try to help.

Generating a source distribution
================================

Go the trunk directory and run ``python setup.py sdist``
