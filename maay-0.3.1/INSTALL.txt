Maay Installation Manual
========================

.. revision: $Id$


Installing Maay on Windows
==========================

On the Windows platform, it is recommended to use the Windows
installer available from http://developer.berlios.de/projects/maay/ 

and run it. This should
install and setup everything properly. 

Installing Maay on Linux from a package
=======================================

Maay has not yet been packaged for any Linux distribution. Debian
packages are being worked on. Contributions of RPMs for various
RPM-based distributions are welcome. 

Installing Maay from source
===========================

These instruction are intended for people using a unix-like
OS. Windows users are strongly advised to use the Windows installer. 

A few Python libraries are required to make the whole think work. Most
of them should be available in your OS distribution too :

 * logilab common libraries 0.12.1 or above (http://www.logilab.org/projects/common)
 * mysql-python (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python)
 * python-twisted 2.0 or above (http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/)
 * python-twisted-web 0.5 or above (http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/web/)
 * python-nevow 0.6 or above (http://divmod.org/projects/nevow) 
 * python-imaging (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)
 * mxDatetime (http://www.egenix.com/files/python/mxDateTime.html)

You will also need a few helper applications to perform the conversion
of various binary formats to something that Maay can index. There is
probably a prebuilt binary available for your OS distribution
somewhere. You will need to download and install :

 * pdftohtml (http://pdftohtml.sourceforge.net/)
 * antiword (http://www.winfield.demon.nl/)
 * unrtf (http://www.gnu.org/software/unrtf/unrtf.html)
 * ghostscript (http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/)

The indexation part uses a MySQL database, version 4.1
(http://www.mysql.org/). You will need to install such a database or
get in touch with your DBA. The following assumes a local mysql
installation, with no root password. Maay has not been tested with
MySQL 5.0, but it should work. Please report if you encounter problems
with this version of MySQL.

Once everything else is installed, you can point you web browser to
http://developer.berlios.de/projects/maay/ and download the latest
source tarball. Unpack it, go to the newly created directory and run::

 # python setup.py install

Create the MySQL database instance that will store the indexation
data::

 # mysql -u root mysql
 mysql> \. maay/sql/mysql.sql

You're done! Read the README document to learn how to use Maay. 

Working on the bleeding edge
============================

You can download the latest Maay sources from the SVN
repository. Use the following for the initial source checkout::

 svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/maay/trunk

You will also need to download and install all the dependencies
mentionned in the previous section, and to configure a mysql database
as explained. 

When working with this directory structure, you don't have to install
Maay using setup.py. Just add the trunk directory to the PYTHONPATH
environment variable, and run the trunk/maay/bin/maay-node script to
launch the server. The --help command line option will provide
information about what configuration options are available. You can
also copy the ini files in  trunk/maay/configuration/ files to ~/.maay/ and edit
them to match your settings.
